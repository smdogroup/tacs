This command will look for all .f5 files in the current directory and delete any files with the same name but a
.plt, .szplt or .vtk extension, this is useful for clearing space on your filesystem by removing tecplot/paraview files
that can be regenerated from the f5 files when needed. It is also safer than simply running 'rm *.plt *.szplt *.vtk' as
it will only delete the files that can be regenerated from the f5 files.

To clean up all files in the current directory:
> `basename $0`

To also run recursively in all subdirectories that contain .f5 files:
> `basename $0` -s
