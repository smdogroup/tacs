This command will look for all .f5 files in the current directory and delete any files with the same name but a
.plt or .szplt extension, this is useful for clearing space on your filesystem by removing tecplot files that can be
regenerated from the f5 files when needed. It is also safer than simply running 'rm *.plt *.szplt' as it will only
delete the tecplot files that can be regenerated from the f5 files.
