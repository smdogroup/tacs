MPhys
*****
`MPhys <https://pypi.org/project/mphys/>`_ is a package that standardizes high-fidelity multiphysics problems in OpenMDAO.
MPhys provides a convenient interface for connecting TACS problems to optimizers and other physics disciplinary solvers for coupled analysis.
The TACS MPhys interface consists of one main classes: a builder class called :class:`~tacs.mphys.builder.TacsBuilder`.
For more information on the general MPhys interface users should see the MPhys `docs <https://openmdao.github.io/mphys/>`_.
The details of the interfaces will be discussed in the sections below.
