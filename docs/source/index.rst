TACS Overview
=============

The Toolkit for the Analysis of Composite Structures (TACS) is a parallel finite-element code for analysis and gradient-based design of advanced structures. Originally, TACS was primarily designed as a tool for the analysis of shell structures, such as wing-boxes. More recently it has been extended to perform topology optimization of large three-dimensional structures using gradient-based methods.

TACS has been under continuous development since 2010 by the `Structural and Multidisciplinary Design Optimization group at Georgia Tech <http://gkennedy.gatech.edu>`_ and by the `Multidisciplinary Design Optimization Lab at the University of Michigan <http://mdolab.engin.umich.edu/>`_.
